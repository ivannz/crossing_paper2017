	Abstract = {By considering the crossings of size 2n made by a continuous self-similar process, for n = ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., we build a tree of crossings that encodes the sample path. From the crossing tree, we obtain a test for self-similarity and an estimator for the Hurst index, H. The accuracy of the estimator is established theoretically and numerically, and a comparison study with three other estimators is given, demonstrating its superior performance. The estimator and self-similarity test are applied to network packet traces, revealing some previously unobserved features.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We introduce a broad class of self-similar processes { Z ( t ) , t ≥ 0 } called generalized Hermite processes. They have stationary increments, are defined on a Wiener chaos with Hurst index H ∈ ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , and include Hermite processes as a special case. They are defined through a homogeneous kernel g , called the ``generalized Hermite kernel'', which replaces the product of power functions in the definition of Hermite processes. The generalized Hermite kernels g can also be used to generate long-range dependent stationary sequences forming a discrete chaos process { X ( n ) } . In addition, we consider a fractionally-filtered version Z β ( t ) of Z ( t ) , which allows H ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . Corresponding non-central limit theorems are established. We also give a multivariate limit theorem which mixes central and non-central limit theorems. },

@article{Dietrich:1997:FES:257708.257735,
	Abstract = {Geostatistical simulations often require the generation of numerous realizations of a stationary Gaussian process over a regularly meshed sample grid $\Omega$. This paper shows that for many important correlation functions in geostatistics, realizations of the associated process over $m+1$ equispaced points on a line can be produced at the cost of an initial FFT of length $2m$ with each new realization requiring an additional FFT of the same length. In particular, the paper first notes that if an $(m+1)\times(m+1) $ Toeplitz correlation matrix $R$ can be embedded in a nonnegative definite $2M\times2M$ circulant matrix $S$, exact realizations of the normal multivariate $y \sim {\cal N}(0,R)$ can be generated via FFTs of length $2M$. Theoretical results are then presented to demonstrate that for many commonly used correlation structures the minimal embedding in which $M = m$ is nonnegative definite. Extensions to simulations of stationary fields in higher dimensions are also provided and illustrated.},

CEM consists in embedding the N/spl times/N covariance matrix of the stationary fGn process in a larger 2M/spl times/2M circulant matrix such that M /spl ges/N-1. CEM is exact, since second-order statistics of the generated data are those of the Gaussian fGn. CEM is fast, since the optimal case M=N-1 can be reached. Fast and exact fBm sequences can be easily recovered from fGn ones.},

Such processes have been proposed as models for high-frequency financial data, such as currency exchange rates, where there are known to be daily and weekly periodic fluctuations in the volatility, captured here by the periodic activity function. We review an existing estimator for the activity function then propose three new methods for estimating it and present some experimental studies of their performance. We finish with an application to some foreign exchange and FTSE100 futures data.},

	Abstract = {We give characterisations for Brownian motion and continuous local martingales, using the crossing tree, which is a sample-path decomposition based on first-passages at nested scales. These results are based on ideas used in the construction of Brownian motion on the Sierpinski gasket (Barlow and Perkins 1988). Using our characterisation we propose a test for the continuous martingale hypothesis, that is, that a given process is a continuous local martingale. The crossing tree gives a natural break-down of a sample path at different spatial scales, which we use to investigate the scale at which a process looks like a continuous local martingale. Simulation experiments indicate that our test is more powerful than an alternative approach which uses the sample quadratic variation.},

@article{WRCR:WRCR6232,
	Abstract = {To generate multidimensional Gaussian random fields over a regular sampling grid, hydrogeologists can call upon essentially two approaches. The first approach covers methods that are exact but computationally expensive, e.g., matrix factorization. The second covers methods that are approximate but that have only modest computational requirements, e.g., the spectral and turning bands methods. In this paper, we present a new approach that is both exact and computationally very efficient. The approach is based on embedding the random field correlation matrix R in a matrix S that has a circulant/block circulant structure. We then construct products of the square root S1/2 with white noise random vectors. Appropriate sub vectors of this product have correlation matrix R, and so are realizations of the desired random field. The only conditions that must be satisfied for the method to be valid are that (1) the mesh of the sampling grid be rectangular, (2) the correlation function be invariant under translation, and (3) the embedding matrix S be nonnegative definite. These conditions are mild and turn out to be satisfied in most practical hydrogeological problems. Implementation of the method requires only knowledge of the desired correlation function. Furthermore, if the sampling grid is a d-dimensional rectangular mesh containing n points in total and the correlation between points on opposite sides of the rectangle is vanishingly small, the computational requirements are only those of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of a vector of dimension 2dn per realization. Thus the cost of our approach is comparable with that of a spectral method also implemented using the FFT. In summary, the method is simple to understand, easy to implement, and is fast.},
